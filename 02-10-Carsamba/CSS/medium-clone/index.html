        You can’t write code 24/7. In fact, you shouldn’t. If you find yourself
        pulling more and more all-nighters or marathon coding sessions then you
        are probably pushing subpar code. If you don’t take breaks to let your
        mind work on other things, or stop to consider the design decisions of
        your project then you won’t operate at your best. Your brain needs time
        for reflection, and to zone out. You need time to step back and examine
        big picture items.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        The longer you go down a rabbit hole of writing line after line only
        prolongs the inevitable. You’ll burn out, get discouraged and lose
        focus. What’s worse, you might even make poor architecture decisions
        that only lead to more work in the long run.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        Don’t give in to the culture of hyper-productivity by thinking the more
        you code the better you are. This is true if you’re learning a new
        language or trying to cement syntax fundamentals in your brain, but this
        stops working down the road. You need to take time to do other things.
        Write code and then reflect on that code, whether consciously or
        subconsciously.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        In this article we’ll explore some activities you can use to not only
        take breaks from coding sessions, but also expand your abilities as a
        developer. On the surface some of these activities might seem simple
        but, they teach us important skills and sharpen our mind to become even
        better developers. Elements of problem solving, pattern recognition and
        patient craftsmanship are present in many common hobbies and activities.
        Let’s explore a few of these.

      <p class="text-paragraf">
        Sort of. I’m not talking about mindless first-person shooter games,
        though. I’m referring to strategy games, sandbox games, puzzle games,
        games that force you to plan, adapt, recognize patterns and problem
        solve. Managing resources, planing an attack or solving a puzzle all
        contribute to making you a sharper developer.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">But how?</p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        In these kinds of games you are forced to think ahead and to test
        strategies. You can build something, move it, build it again. You can
        allocate resources into different areas of research and see how it
        impacts the overall technology tree. All of these elements draw massive
        parallels to coding. When you develop an application you’re doing the
        same thing. You’re testing strategies and solving puzzles. The only
        difference is that there usually aren’t any fancy graphics associated
        with the work.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        There are a staggering number of great games that exemplify these key
        developer elements. A few that I’ve enjoyed are listed below with some
        notes about why they’re so useful:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minecraft (design thinking, planning and systems architecture)
          </li>
          <li>
            Civilization V (critical thinking, planning and problem solving)
          </li>
          <li>Portal / Portal 2 (problem solving, pattern recognition)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h1 class="sub-title">Small electronics projects</h1>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        When you learn the fundamentals of electronics and get your hands dirty
        with how circuits work you strengthen your understanding of systems.
        Systems are present everywhere, especially in software development.
        Working with an electrical network of hardware circuits and components
        is similar to working with a system of software. The core concepts
        remain the same with regards to efficient design and effective planning.
        Working with electronics teaches you to build better systems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        As you begin to layout a circuit and connect the components together
        you’ll build not only physical hardware engineering skills but technical
        design skills as well. These translate directly into your role as a
        developer and give you a different perspective on building complex
        systems. You’ll also be forced to work with a less forgiving physical
        medium. If you make a mistake you can’t just delete it and start over.
        With electronics you might accidentally destroy a component or be forced
        to de-solder an entire board and start from scratch.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        If you haven’t worked with electronics before there is no better time to
        start than right now. There is a plethora of free educational material
        online and DIY kits are available for exceptionally low cost from
        multiple sources. Some fantastic resources to get started with are
        available below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arduino (low-cost microcontroller kits and modules)</li>
        <li>
          Adafruit (basic to advanced DIY project kits and parts supplier)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="sub-title">Woodworking</h1>

      <p class="text-paragraf">
        Consistent with key fundamentals of planning, design and working with
        your hands, woodworking is also a great way to take a technology break.
        You get to work with a completely different medium, navigate new
        technical design challenges and you get to step away from tech
        completely. Components are not hidden away behind abstraction layers and
        interfaces. Wood is wood. If you make a mistake you see it immediately.
        Crafting wooden objects by hand requires careful attention to detail and
        teaches you a high degree of patience.

        The next time you’re complaining about waiting for some code to compile,
        imagine having to wait 8 hours for glue to set. This level of patience
        and attention to craftsmanship will translate readily into your
        engineering work when you return to it.

      <h1 class="sub-title">Drawing / Diagramming</h1>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        Take a break and put pen to paper, marker to whiteboard or quill to
        parchment. Whatever drawing medium suits you, taking time to sketch out
        ideas or even just doodle will provide your brain with a much needed
        reset. Even if you think an idea is simple and you know all the pieces
        involved, there is a high probability drawing it out as a diagram or
        sketch will uncover hidden elements.
      </p>
      <p class="text-paragraf">
        When you draw the components of an idea out on paper they start out as
        islands. As the idea is fleshed out you connect everything together
        visually and see how things might operate. Where dependencies might be
        missing, how a connection might not work as you had initially thought.
        This process slowly walks your brain through the architecture of an idea
        instead of flying straight into coding / problem-solving mode.
      </p>

      <p class="text-paragraf">
        If pen and paper still isn’t your thing, you can always spend some
        “code-free” time with a visual diagramming application like Mermaid.
        Check out Making Diagrams Fun With Mermaid by Ozan Tunca for a superb
        guide.
      </p>

      <h1 class="sub-title">Exercise</h1>

      <p class="text-paragraf">
        I can’t tell you how many ideas I’ve come up with and problems I’ve
        solved while out on a run. Zoning out while exercising might not seem
        like an effective way to come up with solutions, but it actually works
        quite well. Sometimes all it takes is focusing your attention away from
        the issue you’re trying to solve. If you keep hammering against the same
        thought process for too long you’ll just end up in a rut spinning your
        wheels. Escaping for a quick bout of physical activity frees your mind
        to wander and brings sub-conscious solutions to the foreground.

      <p class="text-paragraf">
        Aside from the obvious physical health benefits of exercise, there are
        many mental benefits. A sharper memory and ability to problem solve top
        the list of benefits for developers. I’ve personally noticed that I
        write more efficient code and produce less errors following a good
        workout. The workout doesn’t have to be peak intensity either, sometimes
        a short walk is all it takes to have that “Aha!” moment.
