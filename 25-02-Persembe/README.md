# Capitals of Countries

## [Demo](https://cihatdev.github.io/capitals-of-countries/)

This project is a project that I made to learn about the capitals of the countries. It is a project I made with SCSS and Pure JavaScript to improve myself and learn about country capitals.

## Description

In this project, I used the open-source leaflet map and the population API by making fetch. It is a simple project that will write input in the name of the desired country and show it with a pointer to the country you want on the map.
